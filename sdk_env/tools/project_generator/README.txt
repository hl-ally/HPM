proj_gen is a GUI tool maintained and supported by HPMicro, which is used to configure and build samples in hpm_sdk.

proj_gen is built using Qt 5.12.9.

Usage:
1. You can run proj_gen by "start_gui" in sdk_env directory, or double click it directly. We strongly suggest you to use "start_gui", which
will load sdk_env directory automatically.

2. In proj_gen, you need to set the sdk_env path first, and the configurations in sdk_env will be load automatically.

3. You can set the advanced configurations by click the "Advanced" button, such as hpm sdk path, tools, toolchains and so on.

4. Before generate project, you need to select sample, board and type.

5. You can set the build path individually or in the same output directory by check the checkbox.

6. When you click "Generate Project" button, proj_gen will be generated the sample project.

7. After generating, you can open the project ide or open the build path console to build the project manually.
